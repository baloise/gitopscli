# Getting started

The GitOps CLI provides several commands which can be used to perform typical operations on GitOps managed infrastructure repositories. You can print a help page listing all available commands with `gitopscli --help`:

```
usage: gitopscli [-h]
                 {deploy,sync-apps,add-pr-comment,create-preview,delete-preview,version}
                 ...
